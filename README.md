# Kebab vs Bar
A game for the Java university subject.
The game consists of a battle between a kebab shop owner and a bar owner. It is inspired by the famous Madrid neighborhood of Malasa√±a.

There are many features that have not been implemented due to lack of time, although the game code is designed to be programmable. These include:
- Add more than two players.
- Add NPCs to multiplayer games.
- There is a texture manager to help implement more tiles, player sprites and bullets.
